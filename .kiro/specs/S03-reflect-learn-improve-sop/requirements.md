# Requirements Document: S03 - Reflect, Learn, Improve Standard Operating Procedure

## Introduction

**The Problem**: S01 and S02 failed because we made bad decisions easy and good decisions hard.

**The Solution**: Make good decisions easy and bad decisions hard.

**Shreyas Doshi Insight**: "Don't fix people. Fix the system that makes people make bad choices."

## The Three Core Problems

1. **Manual testing felt faster** (but wasn't)
2. **Custom scripts felt simpler** (but weren't) 
3. **"It works" felt sufficient** (but wasn't)

## The Three Core Solutions

1. Make automated testing feel faster than manual testing
2. Make professional tools feel simpler than custom scripts  
3. Make "provably works" feel more satisfying than "probably works"

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Find the Friction Points

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand exactly where good practices felt harder than bad practices, so I can flip that friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to test something THEN automated testing SHALL feel faster than manual testing
2. WHEN I need to validate a claim THEN writing a benchmark SHALL feel easier than making an unsubstantiated claim  
3. WHEN I need to deploy something THEN using professional tools SHALL feel simpler than writing custom scripts
4. WHEN I complete a task THEN having automated validation SHALL feel more satisfying than manual verification

### Requirement 2: Make Good Choices Obvious

**User Story:** As a developer, I want good engineering practices to feel obviously better than bad practices, so I naturally choose them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write a test first THEN I SHALL get immediate feedback that makes debugging unnecessary
2. WHEN I use professional tools THEN I SHALL get working solutions faster than custom scripts
3. WHEN I write executable specifications THEN I SHALL get clearer requirements than narrative descriptions  
4. WHEN I automate validation THEN I SHALL get higher confidence than manual verification

### Requirement 3: Create Simple Forcing Functions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want systems that make it harder to do bad engineering than good engineering, so good engineering happens automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I try to mark a task complete THEN the system SHALL require passing tests before allowing completion
2. WHEN I try to make a performance claim THEN the system SHALL require a benchmark before accepting the claim
3. WHEN I try to write a custom script THEN the system SHALL suggest professional alternatives that are easier to use
4. WHEN I try to skip testing THEN the system SHALL make testing feel faster than skipping

## That's It

Three simple requirements. Three simple solutions.

**The Shreyas Doshi Way**: Don't solve 100 problems. Solve the 3 problems that cause the other 97.

## Success Metrics

**Simple Test**: Can a new developer join the team and naturally do the right thing without being told?

If yes, we fixed the system.  
If no, we didn't.

## The Real Insight

S01 and S02 didn't fail because we're bad at TDD.  
They failed because we made TDD feel hard.

Fix that, fix everything.
