# Requirements Document: S03 - Reflect, Learn, Improve Standard Operating Procedure

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive technical analysis framework for understanding why S01 (Campfire Rust Rewrite) and S02 (Shreyas Doshi GTM) failed to achieve their intended outcomes. The goal is to systematically analyze scope, architecture, implementation, and process decisions to extract actionable insights for future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Scope Analysis Framework

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want to systematically analyze the scope decisions in S01 and S02, so that I can understand what was included, excluded, and why those decisions led to specific outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing S01 scope THEN I SHALL document every feature included in the MVP and evaluate whether it was essential for the stated goals
2. WHEN analyzing S02 scope THEN I SHALL document every GTM component and evaluate whether it addressed the core user adoption challenges
3. WHEN comparing scopes THEN I SHALL identify scope creep patterns and their impact on project complexity
4. WHEN evaluating scope decisions THEN I SHALL analyze the trade-offs between feature completeness and delivery speed
5. WHEN documenting scope analysis THEN I SHALL provide specific recommendations for future scope management

### Requirement 2: Architecture Decision Analysis Framework

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want to systematically analyze the architecture decisions in S01 and S02, so that I can understand which architectural choices contributed to success or failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing S01 architecture THEN I SHALL document every major architectural decision and its rationale
2. WHEN analyzing S02 architecture THEN I SHALL document the CI/CD and testing architecture decisions and their outcomes
3. WHEN evaluating architecture complexity THEN I SHALL measure the gap between stated simplicity goals and actual implementation complexity
4. WHEN analyzing coordination patterns THEN I SHALL identify where "anti-coordination mandates" were violated and why
5. WHEN documenting architecture analysis THEN I SHALL provide specific architectural principles that would prevent identified problems

### Requirement 3: Implementation Quality Analysis Framework

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want to systematically analyze the implementation quality in S01 and S02, so that I can understand which implementation patterns led to maintainability issues or development friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing S01 implementation THEN I SHALL evaluate code quality, test coverage, and adherence to stated principles
2. WHEN analyzing S02 implementation THEN I SHALL evaluate the gap between professional tool goals and actual custom script usage
3. WHEN measuring implementation complexity THEN I SHALL quantify the difference between intended simplicity and actual complexity
4. WHEN evaluating developer experience THEN I SHALL identify specific friction points that made good practices feel harder than bad practices
5. WHEN documenting implementation analysis THEN I SHALL provide specific coding standards and practices that would improve future implementations

### Requirement 4: Process and Workflow Analysis Framework

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want to systematically analyze the development processes used in S01 and S02, so that I can understand which process decisions contributed to project outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing S01 process THEN I SHALL document the actual development workflow and compare it to TDD-first principles
2. WHEN analyzing S02 process THEN I SHALL document the testing and validation workflow and evaluate its effectiveness
3. WHEN evaluating process adherence THEN I SHALL identify where stated methodologies were abandoned and why
4. WHEN analyzing process friction THEN I SHALL quantify the time and effort costs of following stated best practices
5. WHEN documenting process analysis THEN I SHALL provide specific process improvements that would reduce friction while maintaining quality

### Requirement 5: Technical Debt and Maintenance Analysis Framework

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want to systematically analyze the technical debt accumulated in S01 and S02, so that I can understand the long-term maintainability implications of the architectural and implementation decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing S01 technical debt THEN I SHALL identify all areas where shortcuts were taken and their impact on maintainability
2. WHEN analyzing S02 technical debt THEN I SHALL identify all custom solutions that should have used professional tools
3. WHEN evaluating maintenance burden THEN I SHALL quantify the ongoing effort required to maintain the current implementations
4. WHEN analyzing debt patterns THEN I SHALL identify systemic issues that led to technical debt accumulation
5. WHEN documenting debt analysis THEN I SHALL provide specific refactoring strategies and debt reduction plans

### Requirement 6: Success Metrics and Outcome Analysis Framework

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want to systematically analyze the stated success metrics versus actual outcomes in S01 and S02, so that I can understand why the projects failed to meet their goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing S01 outcomes THEN I SHALL compare stated MVP goals with actual user adoption and deployment success
2. WHEN analyzing S02 outcomes THEN I SHALL compare stated GTM goals with actual installation and usage metrics
3. WHEN evaluating success metrics THEN I SHALL identify which metrics were vanity metrics versus meaningful indicators
4. WHEN analyzing outcome gaps THEN I SHALL identify the root causes of the difference between intended and actual results
5. WHEN documenting outcome analysis THEN I SHALL provide specific recommendations for better success metrics and measurement strategies

### Requirement 7: Comparative Analysis Framework

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want to systematically compare S01 and S02 approaches, so that I can understand which strategies were effective across both projects and which were consistently problematic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing architectural approaches THEN I SHALL identify patterns that appeared in both projects and their outcomes
2. WHEN comparing implementation strategies THEN I SHALL identify which approaches were consistently successful or problematic
3. WHEN comparing process decisions THEN I SHALL identify which methodologies were effective versus those that created friction
4. WHEN evaluating cross-project patterns THEN I SHALL identify systemic issues that affected both projects
5. WHEN documenting comparative analysis THEN I SHALL provide specific recommendations that address patterns observed across both projects

### Requirement 8: Future Improvement Recommendations Framework

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want to synthesize all analysis findings into actionable recommendations, so that future projects can avoid the identified pitfalls and leverage successful patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synthesizing scope findings THEN I SHALL provide specific scope management principles and practices
2. WHEN synthesizing architecture findings THEN I SHALL provide specific architectural guidelines and constraints
3. WHEN synthesizing implementation findings THEN I SHALL provide specific coding standards and development practices
4. WHEN synthesizing process findings THEN I SHALL provide specific workflow improvements and friction reduction strategies
5. WHEN documenting recommendations THEN I SHALL provide measurable success criteria and validation methods for each recommendation
