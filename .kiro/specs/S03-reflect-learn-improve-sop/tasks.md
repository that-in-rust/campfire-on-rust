# Implementation Plan: S03 - Reflect, Learn, Improve Standard Operating Procedure

## Phase 1: Measure Current Friction (Week 1)

- [ ] 1. Time Manual vs Automated Testing
  - Create stopwatch measurements for common testing scenarios
  - Measure actual time for manual verification vs writing automated tests
  - Document the hidden costs (rework, debugging, confidence loss)
  - Create friction report showing where manual testing feels faster but isn't
  - _Requirements: 1.1 - automated testing SHALL feel faster than manual testing_

- [ ] 2. Count Steps in Custom vs Professional Tools
  - Audit current custom scripts and count actual steps to working solution
  - Test professional alternatives (act, goss, testcontainers) and count their steps
  - Measure setup time, learning curve, and maintenance overhead
  - Create comparison report showing true complexity costs
  - _Requirements: 1.3 - professional tools SHALL feel simpler than custom scripts_

- [ ] 3. Survey Satisfaction with "Probably" vs "Provably" Works
  - Interview team about confidence levels with manual verification
  - Measure anxiety/confidence when deploying manually tested vs automatically validated code
  - Document the psychological costs of uncertainty
  - Create satisfaction report showing emotional benefits of proof
  - _Requirements: 1.4 - automated validation SHALL feel more satisfying than manual verification_

## Phase 2: Build Templates That Make Good Practices Easier (Week 1)

- [ ] 4. Create Test Templates for Common Patterns
  - Build cargo command: `cargo test --template <pattern>` that generates working test code
  - Create templates for: API endpoints, database operations, WebSocket connections, file operations
  - Make templates faster to fill out than to write from scratch
  - Test that templates actually reduce time-to-working-test
  - _Requirements: 2.1 - writing tests first SHALL get immediate feedback that makes debugging unnecessary_

- [ ] 5. Create Benchmark Templates for Performance Claims
  - Build cargo command: `cargo bench --claim <performance-claim>` that generates criterion benchmarks
  - Create templates for: startup time, memory usage, request latency, throughput
  - Make benchmark creation easier than making unsubstantiated claims
  - Test that benchmarks catch performance regressions automatically
  - _Requirements: 2.2 - using professional tools SHALL get working solutions faster than custom scripts_

- [ ] 6. Create CI/CD Templates Using Professional Tools
  - Build one-command setup: `cargo cicd --tool <act|goss|testcontainers>` 
  - Create working GitHub Actions workflows using act for local testing
  - Create server validation using goss with clear pass/fail results
  - Create infrastructure testing using testcontainers with realistic environments
  - Test that professional tools are actually simpler than custom scripts
  - _Requirements: 2.3 - executable specifications SHALL get clearer requirements than narrative descriptions_

## Phase 3: Add Forcing Functions That Make Bad Practices Harder (Week 1)

- [ ] 7. Require Tests for Task Completion
  - Modify task tracking system to require passing tests before marking complete
  - Create clear error messages when tests are missing: "Task cannot be completed without automated validation"
  - Make test requirement feel helpful, not punitive
  - Test that developers naturally write tests to complete tasks
  - _Requirements: 3.1 - system SHALL require passing tests before allowing completion_

- [ ] 8. Require Benchmarks for Performance Claims
  - Detect performance claims in documentation and require corresponding benchmarks
  - Create clear error messages: "Performance claim requires benchmark validation"
  - Auto-generate benchmark templates when claims are detected
  - Test that developers naturally add benchmarks to support claims
  - _Requirements: 3.2 - system SHALL require benchmark before accepting performance claims_

- [ ] 9. Suggest Professional Alternatives to Custom Scripts
  - Detect when developers create custom bash scripts
  - Automatically suggest professional alternatives with one-command setup
  - Show side-by-side comparison of complexity and maintenance costs
  - Make professional alternatives feel obviously better
  - Test that developers naturally choose professional tools over custom scripts
  - _Requirements: 3.3 - system SHALL suggest professional alternatives that are easier to use_

- [ ] 10. Make Testing Feel Faster Than Skipping
  - Create instant test feedback loops with clear pass/fail results
  - Show time saved by catching issues early vs debugging later
  - Make test-first development feel more efficient than debug-later development
  - Test that developers naturally write tests first because it's faster
  - _Requirements: 3.4 - system SHALL make testing feel faster than skipping_

## Phase 4: Validate System Improvements (Week 1)

- [ ] 11. Measure New Friction Levels
  - Re-run all Phase 1 measurements after implementing improvements
  - Compare before/after friction levels for all three core problems
  - Document actual time savings and satisfaction improvements
  - Verify that good practices now feel easier than bad practices
  - _Requirements: All requirements - validate that friction has been flipped_

- [ ] 12. Test with New Developer
  - Have someone unfamiliar with the system try to complete common tasks
  - Observe whether they naturally choose good practices without being told
  - Document any remaining friction points or confusion
  - Adjust system based on natural behavior patterns
  - _Requirements: Success criteria - new developer naturally does the right thing_

- [ ] 13. Create Self-Reinforcing Feedback Loops
  - Implement system that celebrates good choices with positive feedback
  - Create visible metrics showing team improvement over time
  - Make good practices feel rewarding and bad practices feel unsatisfying
  - Test that the system becomes more effective over time
  - _Requirements: All requirements - create sustainable improvement system_

## Success Validation

### Week 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] We have precise measurements of where good practices feel harder than bad practices
- [ ] We understand the true costs (time, complexity, satisfaction) of current approaches
- [ ] We have clear targets for improvement

### Week 2 Success Criteria  
- [ ] Test templates are faster to use than writing tests from scratch
- [ ] Benchmark templates are easier than making unsubstantiated claims
- [ ] Professional tool templates are simpler than custom scripts

### Week 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completion naturally requires tests (feels helpful, not punitive)
- [ ] Performance claims naturally include benchmarks (feels obvious, not forced)
- [ ] Professional tools are suggested automatically (feels convenient, not preachy)

### Week 4 Success Criteria
- [ ] New developer naturally chooses good practices without being told
- [ ] Good practices feel faster, simpler, and more satisfying than bad practices
- [ ] System reinforces good choices and discourages bad choices automatically

## The Implementation Philosophy

**Shreyas Doshi Approach**: Don't build a system that forces good behavior. Build a system where good behavior is the obvious choice.

**Each task must**:
- Make good practices feel easier than bad practices
- Provide immediate positive feedback for good choices
- Remove friction from doing the right thing
- Add gentle friction to doing the wrong thing

**Result**: Developers choose TDD, professional tools, and automated validation because they're obviously better, not because they're required.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't**:
- Create complex systems that require training
- Add bureaucracy that slows down development
- Make developers feel punished for past choices
- Build tools that require discipline to use

**Do**:
- Create simple systems that work immediately
- Make development faster and more confident
- Make developers feel smart for choosing good practices
- Build tools that make good choices feel natural

## The Meta-Goal

By the end of 4 weeks, we should have a system where:
- A new developer joins and naturally writes tests first (because it's faster)
- A new developer naturally uses professional tools (because they're simpler)  
- A new developer naturally validates claims (because it's more satisfying)

**If this happens, we've fixed the system that makes people make bad choices.**
