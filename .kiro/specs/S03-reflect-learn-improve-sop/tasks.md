## Implementation Philosophy

**Evidence-Based Analysis**: Every finding must be supported by concrete evidence from spec files, code, or measurable outcomes. No subjective opinions or assumptions.

**Systematic Approach**: Use structured frameworks to ensure comprehensive coverage of all aspects (scope, architecture, implementation, process, debt, metrics).

**Actionable Insights**: Transform analysis findings into specific, measurable recommendations that can guide future development decisions.

**Validation-Driven**: Continuously validate analysis results against known project outcomes to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't**:
- Make subjective judgments without evidence
- Focus on blame or criticism of past decisions
- Generate vague or unmeasurable recommendations
- Skip validation of analysis results

**Do**:
- Base all findings on concrete evidence
- Focus on understanding why decisions were made and their outcomes
- Generate specific, actionable recommendations with success criteria
- Validate analysis accuracy against known results

## The Meta-Goal

By the end of 4 weeks, we should have:
- **Comprehensive Understanding**: Clear, evidence-based analysis of why S01 and S02 failed to achieve their goals
- **Systemic Insights**: Identification of patterns and issues that affected both projects
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific improvements that can prevent similar failures in future projects
- **Validated Framework**: Proven analysis methodology that can be applied to future project retrospectives

**If this succeeds, we'll have transformed subjective "lessons learned" into objective, measurable insights that can guide future architectural and process decisions.**
