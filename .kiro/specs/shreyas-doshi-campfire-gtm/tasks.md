## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Fix compilation errors manually, don't build automated systems
- Test every change on clean environments
- Prioritize working software over perfect code
- Use simple solutions over complex architectures

### Testing Strategy
- Test each installation method on clean machines
- Verify every command in documentation works
- Focus on user experience, not just technical correctness
- Get feedback from real users during development

### Shreyas Doshi Principles Applied
- Remove friction, don't add complexity
- Get users to working software immediately
- Be honest about what works vs what doesn't
- Focus on deployment success, not vanity metrics
- Two clear paths, no choice paralysis
