- [ ] 10. Add Simple Success Tracking
  - Add basic analytics to track "Deploy Now" button clicks
  - Track successful vs failed deployments
  - Identify most common deployment failure points
  - Use simple tools (Google Analytics) rather than custom implementation
  - Focus on deployment success metrics, not complex user journeys
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 11. Establish Honest Credibility
  - Replace marketing claims with honest, measured information
  - Show real metrics where available, remove unverified claims
  - Be clear about MVP status and core feature focus

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Fix compilation errors manually, don't build automated systems
- Test every change on clean environments
- Prioritize working software over perfect code
- Use simple solutions over complex architectures

### Testing Strategy
- Test each installation method on clean machines
- Verify every command in documentation works
- Focus on user experience, not just technical correctness
- Get feedback from real users during development

### Shreyas Doshi Principles Applied
- Remove friction, don't add complexity
- Get users to working software immediately
- Be honest about what works vs what doesn't
- Focus on deployment success, not vanity metrics
- Two clear paths, no choice paralysis
