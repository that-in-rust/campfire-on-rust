## IMPORTANT FOR VISUALS AND DIAGRAMS

ALL DIAGRAMS WILL BE IN MERMAID ONLY TO ENSURE EASE WITH GITHUB - DO NOT SKIP THAT
## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the **MVP Phase 1** of rewriting the existing Ruby on Rails Campfire chat application using **simple, proven patterns** that prioritize rapid delivery and Rails compatibility over architectural innovation.

**Strategic Focus: Rails-Compatible Simplicity**
- **Direct Implementation**: Build working chat features using proven Rails patterns adapted to Rust
- **Rust Performance**: Leverage Rust's natural speed, memory safety, and zero-cost abstractions
- **Single Binary**: Zero coordination overhead with embedded assets using Rust's compile-time inclusion
- **Rails Parity**: Replicate ActionCable and Rails patterns using idiomatic Rust equivalents

**Core Philosophy**: Build a working chat application first, optimize and innovate later based on real usage data.

**Primary Goals:**
- **Working Chat Application**: Complete feature parity with Rails Campfire using Rust web frameworks
- **Rust Performance Benefits**: Natural speed improvements from Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety
- **Simple Deployment**: Single binary with zero coordination overhead leveraging Rust's static compilation
- **Rails Compatibility**: Familiar patterns adapted to Rust's ownership model and type system
- **Evidence-Based Evolution**: Add complexity only when proven necessary

## MVP 1.0 Strategic Focus

### Complete Native Rust Web UI (Included in MVP 1.0)
- ‚úÖ **Complete Rust Web UI** - All components using Askama templates (Rust-native templating) and HTMX (26 template files)
- ‚úÖ **Rich text messaging** - Server-side HTML rendering with formatting, sounds, boosts using Rust string processing
- ‚úÖ **Real-time features** - WebSocket broadcasting using tokio-tungstenite, presence, typing notifications
- ‚úÖ **Room management** - Open/Closed/Direct rooms with membership controls using Rust's type safety
- ‚úÖ **Authentication** - Session management using Rust crypto libraries, bot integration, role-based access
- ‚úÖ **Search functionality** - SQLite FTS5-powered message search with rusqlite bindings
- ‚úÖ **Push notifications** - Web Push with VAPID keys using Rust web-push crates
- ‚úÖ **Sound system** - 59 embedded MP3 files with /play commands using Rust's include_bytes! macro

### Gracefully Deferred to v2.0 (Future Enhancement)
- üö´ **File attachments** - Complete UI shown with "Coming in v2.0" messaging
- üö´ **Avatar uploads** - Text-based initials with upload UI for future
- üö´ **OpenGraph previews** - Link detection with placeholder for future unfurling

**MVP Scope:** Campfire is a web-based chat application that supports multiple rooms with access controls, direct messages, rich text messaging, search, notifications via Web Push, @mentions, and API support for bot integrations. File attachments, avatars, and OpenGraph previews are **gracefully disabled** with clear upgrade messaging.

**Demo Experience:** Following Basecamp's approach, the application includes a complete offline demo mode with pre-loaded realistic data (8 users, 7 rooms, sample conversations) and simple credential-based login for immediate evaluation without setup complexity.

**Deployment Strategy:** Single Rust binary deployment with automatic first-run admin setup, environment-based configuration, and Docker-first approach following Basecamp's proven patterns for simple, reliable deployment.

**Architecture Approach:** Simple 3-layer monolith (Database ‚Üí API ‚Üí WebSocket) with server-rendered HTML using Askama templates, direct SQLite operations via rusqlite, and Rails-inspired patterns adapted to Rust's async/await model for real-time functionality.

## Technical Architecture Context

The simplified MVP implementation includes these core components:
- **Database**: Direct SQLite operations using rusqlite with FTS5 virtual table for message search
- **Real-time**: ActionCable-inspired WebSocket broadcasting using tokio-tungstenite (simple, proven patterns)
- **Authentication**: Rails-style session management using Rust crypto crates with secure tokens and bot API keys
- **Push Notifications**: Web Push with VAPID keys using rust web-push libraries for message notifications
- **Frontend**: Complete server-rendered HTML with Askama templates and HTMX for interactivity
- **Background Jobs**: Simple tokio async tasks for webhook delivery and push notifications
- **Security**: Basic rate limiting using Rust's type system, input validation, content sanitization

**Architecture Philosophy:**
- **Rails Compatibility**: Replicate Rails ActionCable behavior using Rust's async ecosystem, not improve it
- **Simple Patterns**: Use proven Rails patterns implemented in idiomatic Rust with ownership guarantees
- **No Coordination Complexity**: Direct operations leveraging Rust's fearless concurrency, no global event sequencing
- **Evidence-Based**: Add complexity only when Rails proves it's necessary

**Deferred to Future Phases:**
- File Storage: Active Storage equivalent with blob storage, image/video processing using Rust image crates
- Avatar uploads and image processing using Rust's image manipulation libraries
- OpenGraph link unfurling and preview generation using Rust HTTP clients
- Advanced coordination (only if Rails analysis proves necessary)

## Hard Constraints - Anti-Coordination Mandates

**CRITICAL: These constraints are MANDATORY for MVP Phase 1 to prevent coordination complexity madness:**

### üö´ **FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** (Will cause immediate spec rejection)
- **NO coordination layers, coordinators, or event buses** (even though Rust's channels make these easy)
- **NO distributed transactions, sagas, or event sourcing** (despite Rust's excellent async support)
- **NO circuit breakers, retry queues, or complex error recovery** (beyond Rust's Result<T, E>)
- **NO cross-tab coordination or global state synchronization** (even with Rust's Arc/Mutex)
- **NO microservices, service mesh, or distributed architecture** (single Rust binary only)
- **NO message queues, event streams, or async coordination** (beyond basic tokio tasks)
- **NO complex state machines or coordination protocols** (keep Rust's type system simple)

### ‚úÖ **MANDATORY SIMPLICITY PATTERNS**
- **Direct SQLite operations** - Simple INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT queries using rusqlite
- **Basic WebSocket broadcasting** - Direct room-based message sending using tokio-tungstenite
- **Rails-style session management** - Simple cookie-based authentication using Rust crypto crates
- **Simple error handling** - Basic Result<T, E> with user-friendly messages leveraging Rust's error handling
- **Direct function calls** - No async coordination between components beyond basic tokio::spawn
- **Single binary deployment** - Leveraging Rust's static compilation with embedded assets

### üìè **COMPLEXITY LIMITS**
- **Maximum 30 total files** in entire codebase (backend + frontend templates)
- **No file over 300 lines** - Split large files into smaller Rust modules
- **Maximum 2 async operations per request** - Keep request handling simple using tokio
- **Single level of error handling** - Avoid nested Result chains, use Rust's ? operator judiciously
- **Single database connection pool** - No distributed data management, use r2d2 or similar simple pool

### üéØ **RAILS PARITY RULE**
- **If Rails doesn't do it, we don't do it** - Use Rails as the complexity ceiling, adapt to Rust idioms
- **Replicate Rails patterns exactly** - Don't "improve" on proven Rails behavior, just make it memory-safe
- **Evidence-based additions only** - New patterns require Rails precedent, implemented in idiomatic Rust
- **Simple beats clever** - Choose obvious Rust solutions over optimized ones

## Requirements

## Strategic Prioritization: Feature-First Implementation

**Governing Principle**: Build a working chat application using proven Rails patterns adapted to Rust, focusing on user value over architectural innovation.

### Phase 1: Core Chat Functionality
**Primary Focus**: Essential chat features that users need immediately
- **Basic message sending/receiving** - Direct SQLite insert/broadcast using rusqlite and tokio
- **Room-based chat** - Simple room membership checks leveraging Rust's type system
- **User authentication** - Rails-style sessions using Rust crypto libraries only
- **WebSocket connections** - Basic connection management using tokio-tungstenite
- **Message history** - Simple database queries with rusqlite

**Governing Thought**: These represent the absolute minimum viable chat application - anything beyond this scope is deferred to v2.0 unless it's a direct Rails equivalent pattern implemented in idiomatic Rust.
## MVP Sufficiency Assessment

**YES - This MVP is sufficient for a text-only Campfire replacement with exact same UI.**

The MVP includes all essential Campfire features for text-based chat:
- ‚úÖ **Complete UI Parity** - All 26 Askama templates replicate Campfire's exact interface
- ‚úÖ **Core Chat Features** - Message sending, room management, direct messages, @mentions
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Experience** - WebSocket broadcasting, presence, typing indicators
- ‚úÖ **Rich Text Support** - Formatting, sounds (/play commands), message boosts
- ‚úÖ **Search Functionality** - Full-text search across message history
- ‚úÖ **Authentication & Security** - Session management, bot API, role-based access
- ‚úÖ **Push Notifications** - Web Push for message alerts
- ‚úÖ **Sound System** - All 59 embedded MP3 files for /play commands

**Graceful Feature Deferrals:**
- File attachments show "Coming in v2.0" messaging
- Avatar uploads display text initials with future upload UI
- OpenGraph previews show link detection with placeholder

**User Experience**: Identical to original Campfire for text chat with clear upgrade path messaging for deferred features. Users get full chat functionality immediately while understanding what's coming next.

**Technical Completeness**: Single Rust binary with embedded assets, SQLite database, WebSocket real-time features, and Rails-equivalent patterns - everything needed for production text chat deployment.


I hope I get the requirements right
