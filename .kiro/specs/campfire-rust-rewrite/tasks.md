# Implementation Plan - Campfire Rust Rewrite MVP 1.0

## IMPORTANT FOR VISUALS AND DIAGRAMS

ALL DIAGRAMS WILL BE IN MERMAID ONLY TO ENSURE EASE WITH GITHUB - DO NOT SKIP THAT

## Overview

**Strategic Focus**: Build complete text-based Campfire functionality using Rails-equivalent patterns in idiomatic Rust, prioritizing working software over architectural innovation.

**Core Philosophy**: 
- **Rails Parity Rule**: If Rails doesn't do it, we don't do it - replicate Rails patterns exactly using idiomatic Rust
- **Anti-Coordination Mandates**: No coordination layers, event buses, or distributed complexity
- **Single Binary Deployment**: Embedded assets using Rust's compile-time inclusion
- **Type Safety First**: Leverage Rust's type system to prevent bugs at compile-time

## 5 Critical Gaps That Must Be Solved

**Gap #1: client_message_id Deduplication** - UNIQUE constraint on (client_message_id, room_id) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Gap #2: WebSocket Reconnection State** - Track last_seen_message_id per connection ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
**Gap #3: SQLite Write Serialization** - Dedicated Writer Task pattern with mpsc channel ‚ùå PENDING
**Gap #4: Session Token Security** - Rails-equivalent secure token generation ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Gap #5: Basic Presence Tracking** - HashMap<UserId, connection_count> with 60-second TTL ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
