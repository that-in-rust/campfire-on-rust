   - Performance benchmarking
   - Cross-platform compatibility testing

2. **Infrastructure Testing** (L2)
   - File system validation
   - Network accessibility testing
   - Configuration validation
   - Environment setup testing

3. **Integration Testing** (L3)
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Documentation accuracy testing
   - User experience validation
   - Cross-component integration

### No Manual Testing Required

All validation is **fully automated** using:
- Rust test framework (`cargo test`)
- Bash validation scripts
- File system checks
- Network connectivity tests
- Compilation validation
- Documentation parsing
