# Project Documentation

Standard project documentation files moved here to reduce root directory clutter.

## Contents

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community guidelines and behavior expectations
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Detailed contribution guidelines for developers
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy and vulnerability reporting

These remain important project documents but are archived to keep the main repository clean and focused on getting users started quickly.
