# Archive Directory

This directory contains files that were moved from the root to reduce visual clutter while preserving all project history and documentation.

## Contents

- `validation-reports/` - E2E validation summaries and task completion reports
- `project-docs/` - Additional project documentation and guides
- `legacy/` - Legacy files and configurations

All files remain accessible but are organized to keep the main repository clean and focused.
