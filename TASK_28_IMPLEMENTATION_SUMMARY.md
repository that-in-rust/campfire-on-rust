- Bot validation: Confirms demo bot is configured
- Scoring system: Weighted scoring (40% users, 30% rooms, 20% messages, 10% bots)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture
```rust
pub trait DemoServiceTrait: Send + Sync {
    async fn get_demo_credentials(&self) -> Result<Vec<DemoUserCredential>>;
    async fn check_demo_integrity(&self) -> Result<DemoIntegrityStatus>;
    async fn ensure_demo_data(&self) -> Result<()>;
    async fn start_simulation_session(&self, user_email: &str, browser_tab_id: &str) -> Result<SimulationSession>;
    async fn get_active_sessions(&self) -> Result<Vec<SimulationSession>>;
    async fn update_session_activity(&self, session_id: &str, features_explored: Vec<String>) -> Result<()>;
    async fn get_tour_steps(&self, user_role: &str) -> Result<Vec<TourStep>>;
    async fn complete_tour_step(&self, session_id: &str, step_id: &str) -> Result<()>;
