- Added tour completion tracking and progress monitoring
- Created feature highlighting with CSS animations

**Key Features:**
- Common tour steps: welcome, rooms sidebar, message input, search feature
- Role-specific steps: admin features, product rooms, dev features
- Interactive tour overlay with progress tracking
- Feature completion criteria and validation
- Tour completion notifications and statistics

### 4. Demo Data Integrity Checking and Validation (Requirement 10.6)
**Implementation:**
- Created `DemoIntegrityStatus` with comprehensive validation
- Implemented integrity scoring system (0.0 to 1.0)
- Added missing component detection and recommendations
- Built automatic demo data repair functionality
- Provided detailed integrity reporting

**Key Features:**
- Validates 8 demo users, 7 demo rooms, 25+ demo messages, bot configuration
- Calculates integrity score based on completeness
- Identifies missing components with specific recommendations
- Automatic initialization when integrity is compromised
- Real-time integrity monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components Created:
1. **`src/services/demo.rs`** - Demo service implementation with all business logic
2. **`src/handlers/demo.rs`** - HTTP handlers for demo API endpoints
3. **`assets/static/js/demo-tour.js`** - Client-side tour and interaction tracking
4. **Enhanced demo templates** - Updated UI with tour integration

### API Endpoints Added:
- `GET /api/demo/credentials` - Get demo user credentials
- `GET /api/demo/integrity` - Check demo data integrity
- `POST /api/demo/ensure-data` - Initialize/repair demo data
- `POST /api/demo/start-session` - Start simulation session
- `GET /api/demo/active-sessions` - Get active sessions
- `POST /api/demo/update-session` - Update session activity
- `GET /api/demo/tour-steps` - Get guided tour steps
- `POST /api/demo/complete-tour-step` - Complete tour step
- `GET /api/demo/statistics` - Get demo statistics
- `GET /demo/guide` - Multi-user simulation guide

### Database Integration:
- Extended AppState with demo service
- Integrated with existing user and room management
- Session tracking in memory with cleanup
- Demo data validation against existing database

## Testing Coverage ✅

### Unit Tests:
- Demo credentials retrieval and validation
- Demo integrity checking and scoring
- Tour step generation for different roles
- Session management and tracking
- Feature exploration tracking

### Integration Tests:
- Multi-user simulation session creation
- Guided tour functionality end-to-end
- Demo data integrity validation
- Credential management for one-click login
- Session tracking and cleanup
