# Campfire CI/CD Requirements

## Introduction

This document defines the executable requirements for Campfire's CI/CD testing architecture following the WHEN...THEN...SHALL format for automated validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Installation Performance

**User Story:** As a developer trying Campfire for the first time, I want the installation to complete quickly, so that I can evaluate the product without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the install script THEN the system SHALL complete installation in under 3 minutes
2. WHEN installation is requested on a clean machine THEN the system SHALL download and start successfully
3. WHEN installation encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 2: Application Startup

**User Story:** As a user starting Campfire, I want the application to start quickly, so that I can begin using it immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `cargo run` THEN the application SHALL start within 5 seconds
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL be accessible at http://localhost:3000
3. WHEN startup fails THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages

### Requirement 3: Database Performance

**User Story:** As a user interacting with Campfire, I want database operations to be fast, so that the interface remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database query is executed THEN the system SHALL complete it within 500 microseconds
2. WHEN multiple queries are executed concurrently THEN the system SHALL maintain performance contracts
3. WHEN query performance degrades THEN the system SHALL detect and report the regression

### Requirement 4: Message Processing

**User Story:** As a team using Campfire for chat, I want message processing to handle high throughput, so that conversations remain smooth during busy periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing messages THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1000 messages per second
2. WHEN message volume increases THEN the system SHALL maintain throughput requirements
3. WHEN throughput drops below threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger performance alerts

### Requirement 5: Memory Efficiency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Campfire to use memory efficiently, so that it doesn't impact other applications on the server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running basic operations THEN the system SHALL use less than 50MB of memory
2. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection
3. WHEN memory limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log warnings and optimize usage

### Requirement 6: CI/CD Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining Campfire, I want automated testing to validate all performance claims, so that I can deploy with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL validate all documented performance contracts
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the tests SHALL fail with clear error messages
3. WHEN tests pass THEN all performance claims SHALL be verified with measurements
4. WHEN baseline performance changes THEN the system SHALL detect and report regressions

### Requirement 7: Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can ensure all functionality is properly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN line coverage SHALL be at least 80%
2. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN branch coverage SHALL be at least 75%
3. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN function coverage SHALL be at least 85%
4. WHEN coverage drops below thresholds THEN quality gates SHALL fail the build

### Requirement 8: Regression Detection

**User Story:** As a development team, I want automatic regression detection, so that performance issues are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL compare against baseline measurements
2. WHEN performance degrades by more than 10% THEN the system SHALL flag it as a regression
3. WHEN regressions are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis
4. WHEN performance improves THEN the system SHALL update baseline measurements

## Success Criteria

- All WHEN...THEN...SHALL criteria have corresponding automated tests
- Performance contracts are validated with criterion benchmarks
- Test coverage meets quality gate requirements
- Regression detection prevents performance degradation
- All claims in documentation are backed by test evidence
